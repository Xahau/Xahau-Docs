# Security Audit

The Hooks amendment, integral to XRPL's smart contract infrastructure, has passed a detailed security audit by FYEO. The audit examined the Hooks framework implementation, including the Hook API, helper functions, and execution environment.&#x20;

With no severe security issues detected and all minor issues resolved, this audit serves as a testament to our commitment to security and the robustness of Hooks.&#x20;

By enabling smart transaction logic directly on XRPL's Layer 1, Hooks bring increased flexibility to tailor applications to their unique needs, inspiring further innovation within the XRPL ecosystem.

Developers now have robust tools for creating and deploying custom logic, accessible on our testnet.

### **Assurance of Ongoing Security**

The audit's successful completion is not just a milestone but a cornerstone for the ongoing security and sustainability of the Hooks network.

With all identified vulnerabilities addressed, the Hooks amendment is set to drive innovation securely on XRPL.
