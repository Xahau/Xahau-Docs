# Transactions

## Transaction Reference

A _Transaction_ is the only way to cause changes in Xahau. Transactions' outcomes are only final if signed, submitted, and accepted into a validated ledger version following the consensus process. Some ledger rules also generate _pseudo-transactions_, which aren't signed or submitted, but still must be accepted by consensus. Transactions that fail are also included in ledgers because they modify balances of XAH to pay for the anti-spam \[transaction cost]\[].
