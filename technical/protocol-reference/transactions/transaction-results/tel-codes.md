# TEL Codes

These codes indicate an error in the local server processing the transaction; it is possible that another server with a different configuration or load level could process the transaction successfully. They have numerical values in the range of -399 to -300. The exact code for any given error is subject to change, so don't rely on it.

**Caution:** Transactions with `tel` codes are not applied to ledgers and cannot cause any changes to the Xahau state. However, these transactions may be automatically cached and retried later. Transactions that provisionally failed may still succeed or fail with a different code after being reapplied. For more information, see Finality of Results and Reliable Transaction Submission.

| `telBAD_DOMAIN`                        | The transaction specified a domain value (for example, the `Domain` field of an \[AccountSet transaction]\[]) that cannot be used, probably because it is too long to store in the ledger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `telBAD_PATH_COUNT`                    | The transaction contains too many paths for the local server to process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `telBAD_PUBLIC_KEY`                    | The transaction specified a public key value (for example, as the `MessageKey` field of an \[AccountSet transaction]\[]) that cannot be used, probably because it is not the right length.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE`                     | The transaction did not meet the open ledger cost, but this server did not queue this transaction because it did not meet the queuing restrictions. For example, a transaction returns this code when the sender already has 10 other transactions in the queue. You can try again later or sign and submit a replacement transaction with a higher transaction cost in the `Fee` field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BALANCE`             | The transaction did not meet the open ledger cost and also was not added to the transaction queue because the sum of potential XAH costs of already-queued transactions is greater than the expected balance of the account. You can try again later, or try submitting to a different server. \[New in: rippled 0.70.2]\[]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BLOCKS`              | The transaction did not meet the open ledger cost and also was not added to the transaction queue. This transaction could not replace an existing transaction in the queue because it would block already-queued transactions from the same sender by changing authorization methods. (This includes all \[SetRegularKey]\[] and \[SignerListSet]\[] transactions, as well as \[AccountSet]\[] transactions that change the `RequireAuth`/`OptionalAuth`, `DisableMaster`, or `AccountTxnID` flags.) You can try again later, or try submitting to a different server. \[New in: rippled 0.70.2]\[]                                                      |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_BLOCKED`             | The transaction did not meet the open ledger cost and also was not added to the transaction queue because a transaction queued ahead of it from the same sender blocks it. (This includes all \[SetRegularKey]\[] and \[SignerListSet]\[] transactions, as well as \[AccountSet]\[] transactions that change the `RequireAuth`/`OptionalAuth`, `DisableMaster`, or `AccountTxnID` flags.) You can try again later, or try submitting to a different server. \[New in: rippled 0.70.2]\[]                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_FEE`                 | The transaction did not meet the open ledger cost and also was not added to the transaction queue. This code occurs when a transaction with the same sender and sequence number already exists in the queue and the new one does not pay a large enough transaction cost to replace the existing transaction. To replace a transaction in the queue, the new transaction must have a `Fee` value that is at least 25% more, as measured in fee levels. You can increase the `Fee` and try again, send this with a higher `Sequence` number so it doesn't replace an existing transaction, or try sending to another server. \[New in: rippled 0.70.2]\[] |
| `telCAN_NOT_QUEUE_FULL`                | The transaction did not meet the open ledger cost and the server did not queue this transaction because this server's transaction queue is full. You could increase the `Fee` and try again, try again later, or try submitting to a different server. The new transaction must have a higher transaction cost, as measured in fee levels, than the transaction in the queue with the smallest transaction cost. \[New in: rippled 0.70.2]\[]                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `telFAILED_PROCESSING`                 | An unspecified error occurred when processing the transaction.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `telINSUF_FEE_P`                       | The `Fee` from the transaction is not high enough to meet the server's current transaction cost requirement, which is derived from its load level and network-level requirements. If the individual server is too busy to process your transaction right now, it may cache the transaction and automatically retry later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `telLOCAL_ERROR`                       | Unspecified local error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `telNO_DST`\_`PARTIAL`                 | The transaction is an XAH payment that would fund a new account, but the `tfPartialPayment` flag was enabled.

| `telWRONG_NETWORK`                     | The transaction specifies the wrong `NetworkID` value for the current network. Either specify the correct the `NetworkID` value for the intended network, or submit the transaction to a server that is connected to the correct network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
